            <h1 class="title">About Me</h1>
            <p>My name is Colin Conrad, I am 28 years old and currently I am a software engeneering student at the univeristy of Montana. I enjoy the world of tech and love learning new things</p>
            <p>Before becoming a student, I proudly served in the U.S. Army as an Army Ranger. During my military career, I specialized in the operation and maintenance of advanced communication
               and computing equipment, ensuring the seamless functionality of critical systems in demanding environments. My responsibilities also included implementing and upholding stringent 
               security protocols to protect classified information and technologies. Additionally, I led a small team of Rangers, fostering their technical expertise and personal readiness for 
               extended operations, while cultivating a culture of discipline and resilience.<br>

               My journey began in the small town of Eureka, Montana, where I discovered my passion for computers and technology during high school. This passion ignited a lifelong pursuit of 
               knowledge in IT, computing, and communications. Every decision Iâ€™ve made since has been driven by my desire to deepen my understanding and grow within this dynamic field, aligning 
               my skills and experiences toward achieving my ideal career.
